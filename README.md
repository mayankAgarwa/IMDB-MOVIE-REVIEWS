AI-Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Dataset
Introduction
Given the availability of a large volume of online review data (Amazon, IMDB, etc.), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important. In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of a piece of text being either positive or negative.

Getting the Dataset
The "Large Movie Review Dataset"(*) shall be used for this project. The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB on the condition there are no more than 30 reviews per movie. The numbers of positive and negative reviews are equal. Negative reviews have scores less or equal than 4 out of 10 while a positive review have score greater or equal than 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included. The 50,000 reviews are divided evenly into the training and test set.

The Training Dataset can also be downloaded from: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz.
